# Project Brief

## Overview

Building a game built on Ruby on Rails where the player runs a tavern on a remote human colony and must make money, while keeping the tavern popular. Different events are generated by AI that require the player to make decisions that affect the popularity or finances of the tavern. There is a set of patrons that will visit randomly and these players have their own feeling on the tavern. As time advances, the game will build a history of the tavern

## Core Features

- Uses AI via API key to generate patrons and their backstories and generate events that happen in the tavern
- Keeps track of beer inventory, cost, profit, total tavern bank account, etc. AI generated events can affect these numbers
- Patrons can have feelings about the tavern which affect how often they visit, how long they stay, and how many beers they drink. They can also have feelings about other patrons based on generated events and this affects how they interact in future events.

## Target Users

People who like text based games, especially older BBS style games ands MUD and MUSH games.

## Technical Preferences (optional)

- Uses Ruby on Rails 7.1.3.4 for both the backend and the frontend.
- The frontend can use Hotwire and Turbo as appropriate
- Uses "ruby-openai" package to connect to OpenAI's API for all AI functions
- Tailwind CSS for styling
